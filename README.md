# Direxion-ETF-Performance-Analysis
In this project, we analysed the historical data and characteristics of four exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that offer different levels of exposure to the S&amp;P 500 index: SPY, SPXL, SPXS and SPY.
The analysis involved multiple aspects:

1. Descriptive Data Analysis:
Retrieved historical price data for the ETFs from the Yahoo Finance API, covering the period from January 1st, 2017, to the present. This data was used to create visualizations, compute annualized statistics on daily log-returns (mean, volatility, skewness, kurtosis), compare Sharpe ratios, and generate a correlation matrix of daily returns. These insights were essential in understanding the performance and behavior of the ETFs.

2. Power Profiles and Gamma Effects:
To gain deeper insights into the ETFs' return characteristics, an analysis was conducted. This analysis included plotting VT/V0 as a function of SPYT/SPY0 for rolling one-year returns and considering the trading impact.

3. The Product Provider FAQ :
In this section, the provided FAQ from Direxion, was reviewed. The objective was to evaluate if the FAQ effectively communicated the nature of these products.
